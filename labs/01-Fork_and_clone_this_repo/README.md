When you enter as logged-in user, re-click on **Fork** button at the top-right of the screen. Forking a repository allows you create a copy of the original repo on your GitHub account so as to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.

## Clone the forked repo

When forked the original repo, clone it on your PC.

In the following command, please make sure to change placeolders accordingly:

- \<YOUR PREFERRED FOLDER\> with the folder you want to clone this repo into
- \<YOUR GITHUB ACCOUNT\>  with your actual GitHub account (i.e. mine is denismaggior8)

```
$ cd <YOUR PREFERRED FOLDER>
$ git clone https://github.com/<YOUR GITHUB ACCOUNT>/SNY.OSS.VLT.01.01.00
```

Please note that neither your forked repo, nor your local clone, will receive new commits from the original repo automatically; you need to pull updates manually, please refer to appendix [A - Sync copy of forked repo](../../appendices/A-Sync_copy_of_forked_repo/README.md)
